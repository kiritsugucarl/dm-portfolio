                  <p style="text-indent: 40px; text-align: justify;">
                    Carl is a huge person, yes double dimensions huge. He actually looks scary, looks like it but he's harmless, and its a guarantee.
                  He is the president of CEIT - 37 - 201A, and a simple student in his course. He studied Senior High School in the Rizal Technological
                  University as well but in Pasig Campus. He is just a bored guy who used to watch 1 season of anime per day but now can't even finish 1 episode.
                  He is a grammar nazi, but he seems so gentle even at his size mostly when you knew him, can't even kill a little fly, a real pacifist. An average intellect mind that is properly functioning depending on his mood. Can do some bits of programming, coding, designing(well this is technically his kryptonite), and a bit of logistics with mathematics. His favorite subjects before were computer-related subjects, math, and physics. He aspires to become a fullstack developer, if not he hopes that he'll just become a mafia boss. </p>

                  <p style="text-indent: 40px; text-align: justify;">
                      This site was done for the final requirement of Discrete Math from Professor Jenelyn Luna, and it includes different sections. The collection of the solution for the Activities, Lessons that were included in the Video Lesson, and the things that was learned during the semester in the subject. This is for compliance for the final requirement E-Portfolio.

            <h2>What have I learned in Discrete Math?</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <span>
              Along the way, the subject has taught me different aspects and it is not limited to the lessons itself. It also taught something that can be applied not only
              in the lesson but as well in life.

                <h4>Fundamentals</h4>
                <p>
                  I learned that learning fundamentals is so important so that anywhere or any problem you might face even at such complexity, you will still be able to
                  do it without much issues when you know the fundamentals because you start lower.
                </p>

                <h4>Organization</h4>
                <p>
                  I learned that with proper organization, not only of objects but also thoughts, you can solve any problem at any rate when you have your thoughts organized because when its more compact, you think more logically. The firmer the thoughts, the better.z
                </p>

                <h4>Hardwork</h4>
                <p>
                  I learned that with hardwork, you can make the dream work. As long as you strive for something, a problem hinders you and can't solve it, try different ways to find answers, understand it and you'll less likely find yourself in the same problem again. The rewards are just expanding as you work harder.

                <h4>Basics </h4>
                <p>
                  If the ways you used to have isn't working properly, then start climbing back to basics, before ever facing complex things. If you haven't mastered the basics, you don't know the fundamentals, well you will find it hard at complex problems. When everything else fails, standardize and look at the basics.

            <p> Inverse function is a function where there is a reversal of a function. It can also be defined as undo of the action of the another function. It is denoted as f(x)<sup>-1</sup></p>

              <p>•f and g are both one to one functions. When we say f and g, these are the two functions that we have i.e. f(x) and g(y). One to one functions map each value in their domain to exactly one value in the co-domain(range)</p>

              <h3> Problem 1 :<strong class="highlight"> x + a = y </strong> </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x + a = y </h3>
              <p> Now we have to equate this into x to get the INVERSE of the function. Therefore we can transpose a to the side of y. Now we have : </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = a - y </h3>
              <p> As simple as that, works like a charm doesnt it? Now lets head to the next example :</p>
              <br>


              <h3> Problem 2 :<strong class="highlight"> mx = y </strong> </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> mx = y </h3>
              <p> Always check the operation, we know that the reverse of addition is subtraction and vice versa; the reverse of multiplication is addition and vice versa </p>
              <p> Now, we can divide both sides by m, so that it will be equated to x as the inverse of y. </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = y/m </h3>
              <p> And that is the inverse of the function! </p>
              <br>
              <br>


              <p><strong>Now let us try a much more complicated example</strong></p>
              <h3> Problem 3 :<strong class="highlight"> a(x) = 7x + 3 </strong> </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(x) = 7x + 3 </h3>
              <p> Look complicated, isnt it? But let us take a look on how to invert it so that we can take the inverse of the given function </p>
              <p> First, we have to rewrite the problem into linear equation and switch x and y<p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = 7y + 3 </h3>
              <p> Now after rewriting the expression, we can transpose 3 to the side of x. </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x-3 = 7y </h3>
              <p> After which, we can now divide both sides to 7 to equate it to y </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> (x-3)/7 = y </h3>
              <p class="highlight"> Therefore, we can write it back to function but since its inverse, it is denoted by F(x)<sup>-1</sup>:</p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(x)<sup>-1</sup> = (y-3)/7 </h3>
              <p><i>Remember : Inverse Functions are denoted as f(x)<sup>-1</sup>.</i></p>
              <p> And now, we can check if it is the inverse of the function </p>
              <p><strong> Assuming that x = 1 </strong></p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(1) = 7x + 3 </h3>
              <p> We can substitute the function of x to the x in the expression which is 7x + 3 </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(1) = 7(1) + 3 </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(1) = 7 + 3 </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(1) = 10 </h3>
              <p> Now, we can see that the answer is 10, then we can check the other one </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(x)<sup>-1</sup> = (y-3)/7</h3>
              <p> Now we have to put the answer in the function to the inverse function which in this case, is 10 which now will be : </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = (10-3)/7</h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = 7/7 </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = 1 </h3>
              <p> Now as we can see, it came back to the function 1 that we used. It means its the inverse of the function.
              <br><br>
              <h2 class="center"><strong> OR </strong></h2>
              <p> We can also use the same variable which in our example is 1, so now it can be : </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> a(x)<sup>-1</sup> = (y-3)/7</h3>
              <p> Rewrite the function into y since it is an inverse </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> x = (y-3)/7 </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> 1 = (y-3)/7 </h3>
              <p> Now we can multiply both sides by 7 so we can cancel out the denominator. </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> 7 = y-3 </h3>
              <p> Then transpose -3 to the side of 7 to equate it into y </p>
              <h3 class="highlight"> 7 + 3 = y </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> 10 = y </h3>
              <h3 class="highlight"> y = 10 </h3>
              <p> As you can see, 10 was the result of the first function, and now we also had it in this proofing, which means it is the inverse of the function.</p>
